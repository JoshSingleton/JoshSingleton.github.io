# I Turned My Old Gaming PC Into a Powerful Cybersecurity Homelab

My old gaming rig had served me well for years, but as modern titles demanded more power than it could offer, it slowly stopped being used and sat in storage for months until I thought of a way to repurpose it into something far more educational: a dedicated cybersecurity Homelab.

The machine is powered by an AMD FX-8350 CPU, an 8-core processor, paired with 16GB of DDR3 RAM and an MSI 970 Gaming motherboard. It currently has a 4TB Seagate HDD, which provides plenty of space to spin up virtual machines and store any files I need. While this isn’t exactly a high end setup, it’s more than enough to run the virtual machines and security tools I will be working with.

The base OS is Ubuntu, and I’m using VirtualBox as the virtualization platform. I’ve spun up several virtual machines including Kali Linux, Windows 10, Windows Server 2019, and vulnerable environments like Metasploitable and VulnHub virtual machines within an isolated network to get hands on experience with IT and cybersecurity concepts.

Overall, this Homelab is more than a personal project. It’s a hands on training ground that’s teaching me a wide range of skills across IT and cybersecurity. From setting up infrastructure and configuring networks, to practicing offensive/defensive techniques, this experience is helping me build a solid technical foundation and preparing me for future roles in the industry.
